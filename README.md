# Driving-Robot-with-Object-Oriented-detection-through-OpenCV-with-YOLOv11

I created a script for running an Object-Orientated detection AI model, while tranmitting the outcome to a robot with a Server-Client connection over WiFi. All written in python.

I used a Rasberry Pi 5 and Adafruit DC & Stepper Motor HAT for building the robot. 

# WATCH OUT WITH USING A RASPI 5! THE LIBRARY RPi.GPIO ISN'T COMPATIBLE, WHILE THE HAT MAKES USE OF THIS LIBRARY! SO YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO CONNECT SENSORS!

Go ahead and take a look at the code!
