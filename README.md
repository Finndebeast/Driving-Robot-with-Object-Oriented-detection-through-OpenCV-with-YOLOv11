# Driving-Robot-with-Object-Oriented-detection-through-OpenCV-with-YOLOv11

I created a script for running an Object-Orientated detection AI model, while tranmitting the outcome to a robot with a Server-Client connection over WiFi. All written in python.

I used a Rasberry Pi 5 for building the robot. \n
WATCH OUT WITH USING A RASPI 5! THE LIBRARY RPi.GPIO ISN'T COMPATIBLE!

Go ahead and take a look at the code!
